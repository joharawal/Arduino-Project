# Arduino-Project
This repository contains my Arduino projects during college
1. Automatic Light With Sensor LDR
- How it works:
>This circuit uses an LDR sensor module, a sensor that detects ambient light. When the system is activated, the light will turn on based on the light value on the LDR sensor. I set the LDR threshold to 500. When the LDR sensor value exceeds the threshold, the relay will turn on and activate the light. When the LDR sensor value falls below the threshold, the relay will turn off, turning the light off. All of this logic is controlled by the Arduino Nano. In short, this is an automatic light that will turn on when the room is dark and turn off when the room is bright.
2. Automatic lights with sound sensor
- How it works:
>This circuit uses a sound sensor to control the lights. In this system, I created ClapCount logic, which is a clapping sound. If the sound sensor detects two claps, the relay will turn on and activate the lights. If two claps are detected, the relay will then turn off and turn off the lights. All of this logic is controlled by the Arduino. In short, this system will control the lights with the sound of two claps.
